# spotapi
\code{spotapi} talks to the Spotify API. 

This package makes it much easier for any user to pull information from the Spotify API directly into R, without having to worry about endpoints, JSONs,
or access tokens. 

There is not functionality for all possibly API data, but \code{spotapi} can pull related artists, top tracks, Spotify IDs, Billboard Top 100 data (not 
from Spotify), and audio analysis variables for individual tracks and averaged across artists. 

This package was originally designed to help build a Shiny app for a final project.
